What is QEMU ?
===============

QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to
achieve good emulation speed.

QEMU is used by XenServer is its full system emulation mode. In
this mode, QEMU emulates a full system including one or several
processors and various peripherals. It can be used to launch 
different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug
system code.

QEMU can run without an host kernel driver and yet gives acceptable
performance.
