There are prerequisites for building a QEMU source
release for XenServer. All the following must be installed, either by
visiting the project webpage or installing a pre-built package
provided by your OS distributor:
    * GCC v3.4 or later
    * GNU Make
    * GNU Binutils
    * RPM build
    * Redhat rpm config (if debuginfo is required)
    * Development install of SDL (e.g. SDL-devel)
    * Development install of zlib (e.g., zlib-devel)
    * Development install of Python v2.3 or later (e.g., python-devel)
    * Development install of bzip2 (e.g.,bzip2-devel)
    * Development install of curses (e.g., ncurses-devel)
    * Development install of e2fsprogs (e.g., e2fsprogs-devel)
    * Development install of e4fsprogs (e.g., e4fsprogs-devel)
    * Development install of pciutils (e.g. pciutils-devel)
    * Development install of xen (e.g. xen-devel)
    * Development install of yajl (e.g. libyajl-dev)

    * Binary rpms of yajl can be downloaded from xenserver.com


Follow these steps to build an RPM.

1. Clone the qemu-xen-4.2 git repository to /some/path/qemu-xen-4.2

2. Clone qemu-xen-4.2 patch queue repository to /some/path/qemu-xen-4.2.hg/.git/patches
   
3. cd /some/path/qemu-xen-4.2.hg and then do a `guilt push -a` to apply the patches
     
4. To obtain a xen-device-model-1.8.50.tar.gz file run the following cmd:
     git archive --prefix=xen-device-model-1.8.50/ HEAD | bzip2 -c > xen-device-model-1.8.50.tar.bz2

5. Create diff patch:
     git diff > xen-device-model-development.patch

6. Replace with correct version numbers to create the spec file:
     sed -e s\,@IOEMU_VERSION@,1.8.50,g\
         -e s\,@IOEMU_RELEASE@,74.7586,g\
	  < ./mk/xen-device-model.spec.in  \
	  > xen-device-model.spec

7. Move xen-device-model-1.8.50.tar.bz2 to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
   Move xen-device-model-development.patch to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
   Move xen-device-model.spec to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
	      
8. To build the RPMs run:
     cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
     rpmbuild -ba xen-device-model.spec --target i686
			  
9. Install using
     rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/xen-device-model*.rpm
